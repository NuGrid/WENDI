# The Web Exploration of NuGrid Datasets: Interactive (WENDI)

The interface provides a variety of NuGrid data access, processing and analysis tools via Jupyter notebooks.



## StellarDataSets

NuGrid provides stellar evolution and post-processing nucleosynthesis data for exploration in the ***StellarDataSets*** directory.


## SYGMA

The web interface of The Stellar Yields for Galactic Modeling Applications (SYGMA) module.
The module allows to calculate the ejecta and stellar feedback of simple stellar populations as a function of time.
You can find it in the ***SGYMA*** directory.


## NuPyCEE

The NuGrid Python Chemical Evolution Environment (NuPyCEE) allows to simulate the chemical enrichment and stellar feedback of stellar populations. 
NuPyCEE can be run in the ***NuPyCEE*** directory. Teaching and userguides for NuPyCEE are also provided.
