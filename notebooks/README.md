# The Web Exploration of NuGrid Datasets: Interactive (WENDI)

The interface provides a variety of data access, processing and analysis tools.


## StellarDataSets


## SYGMA

The web interface of The Stellar Yields for Galactic Modeling Applications (SYGMA) module.
The module allows to calculate the ejecta and stellar feedback of simple stellar populations as a function of time.
You can find it in the [SYGMA](SYGMA) directory.


## NuPyCEE

The NuGrid Python Chemical Evolution Environment (NuPyCEE) allows to simulate the chemical enrichment and stellar feedback of stellar populations. 
Teaching and userguides for NuPyCEE are provided.
